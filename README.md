### Description

After Project 3, We have 25 published kaggle datasets, In this project you will have opportunity to work on one dataset from your class's datasets, including define problem statement, an extensive outline of EDA and modeling to date, the goal of your predictive model.


The goal of this project is applying one of **supervised learning algorithms**, **Time Series models** or build **recommendation system**
